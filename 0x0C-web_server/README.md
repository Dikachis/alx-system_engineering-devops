**Web Server:**
Do not mix up web server and server.

A web server is a software that delivers web pages. A server is an actual computer.

But you might hear people referring to a web server using the word server. (Check out the server concept page to learn more about this.)

As mentioned above, a server is a physical machine, an actual computer, but in the Cloud era that could also be a virtual computer, generally called a VM ([Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)) or [container](https://www.cio.com/article/247005/what-are-containers-and-why-do-you-need-them.html).
