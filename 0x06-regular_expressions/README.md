# 0x06. Regular expression
### Background Context
In this project, regular expression was built using Oniguruma, a regular expression library used by Ruby by default. Because the focus of this exercise is to play with regular expressions (regex), here is the Ruby code that you should use, just replace the regexp part, meaning the code in between the ``//:``

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ cat example.rb
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./example.rb 127.0.0.2
127.0.0.2
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./example.rb 127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./example.rb 127.0.0.a
```

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* All files are interpreted on ``Ubuntu 20.04 LTS``
* All files end with a new line
* There is a ``README.md`` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* All Bash script files are executable
* All your regex must be built for the Oniguruma library

### More info
[Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) is a tool that will help you write proper Bash scripts. It will make recommendations on your syntax and semantics and provide advice on edge cases that you might not have thought about. Shellcheck is your friend! **All your Bash scripts must pass ``Shellcheck`` without any error or you will not get any points on the task**. Also, for every feedback, Shellcheck will provide a code that you can use to get more information about the issue, for example for code ``SC2034``, you can browse [https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2034](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2034).
``Shellcheck`` is available on the schoolâ€™s computers. If you want to use it on your own computer, here is how to [install it](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing).
