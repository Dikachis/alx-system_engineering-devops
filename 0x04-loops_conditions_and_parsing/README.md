# BASH Scripting - Loops, conditions and parsing
**Learning the Use of Loops to automate operations in the unix system**

## General Objectives
* To know how to create SSH keys
* To know what the advantage of using ``#!/usr/bin/env bash`` over ``#!/bin/bash``
* To know how to use ``while``, ``until`` and ``for`` loops
* To know how to use ``if``, ``else``, ``elif`` and ``case`` condition statements
* To know how to use the ``cut`` command
* To know what files are, other comparison operators, and how to use them

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* All files are interpreted on ``Ubuntu 20.04 LTS``
* All files end with a new line
* There is a ``README.md`` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* All Bash script files are executable
* Not allowed to use [awk](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-scripting-using-awk/)
* Bash script pass ``Shellcheck (version 0.7.0)`` without any error
* The first line of all Bash scripts are exactly ``#!/usr/bin/env bash``
* The second line of all the Bash scripts has comment explaining what the script doing
### More info
[Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) is a tool that will help you write proper Bash scripts. It will make recommendations on your syntax and semantics and provide advice on edge cases that you might not have thought about. Shellcheck is your friend! **All your Bash scripts must pass ``Shellcheck`` without any error or you will not get any points on the task**. Also, for every feedback, Shellcheck will provide a code that you can use to get more information about the issue, for example for code ``SC2034``, you can browse [https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2034](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2034).
``Shellcheck`` is available on the school’s computers. If you want to use it on your own computer, here is how to [install it](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing).
